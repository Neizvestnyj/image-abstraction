## Changes to make

- Use HSL instead of BGR for colors to allow for equalizing saturation levels
  across the color palette
- Connect colors.json to confighandler to create dict to be used for color
  selection
- Improve efficiency of image quantizing and pixel counting
- Prevent child circle from being same color as parent
- HSL slider to allow user to select set of colours with probability weights
  (intend to integrate with React front-end).
